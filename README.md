Do pull requests if you want to contribute. See TODOS.md for the list of stuff that we need to do.
Feel free to create directories in here for other components that you want to include, modify, etc. in the interop playground, such as SATOSA, pyFF, SimpleSAMLphp, etc. I will be working on the Shibboleth side of things. 

Now with PlantUML diagrams! See documentation folder. You can edit the plantuml using a plugin in your favorite IDE, or run the Docker plantuml/plantuml container.

Thanks! (Nicole Roy)
