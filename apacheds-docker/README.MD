# Docker Apache Directory Server container

This container supplies an installation of Apache Directory Server which can be used in connection with other services/containers to bootstrap demos of components which depend on an LDAP directory, Kerberos, or both.

Dependencies:

-Runtime environment such as Docker Desktop or similar

To build, clone this repo, and then run:

`docker build . -t apacheds`

This will build the container and push it to the local Docker repo. Then, run the container as follows:

`docker run --platform linux/amd64 -dt --name apacheds_container -p 10389:10389 -p 10636:10636 -p 60464:60464 -p 60464:60464/udp -p 60088:60088 -p 60088:60088/udp apacheds:latest`

This will start the container with the necessary ports for:

- LDAP binds
- LDAPS binds
- Remote password changes
- Kerberos KDC

You may then use a client tool such as Apache Directory Studio, the Apache Directory Studio Eclipse plugin, ldapsearch, or client libraries in your programming framework of choice to bind against the directory.

The superuser bind DN is: `cn=test,dc=example,dc=com`
The superuser bind password (plaintext) is: `secret5`

This user can be used to do anything you need to the directory, including serving as a test credential for login to other sysystems backed by this verifier.

It is advisable to change these defaults if you plan to run this container anywhere other than a locked-down development environment.
